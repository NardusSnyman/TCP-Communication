To get started with the project, you will download the project with your preffered method of choice (git, github desktop, zip download) and will import it to visul studio. The projects located in the "Libraries" folder are really the only thing you need, so just import the project of your choice into visual studio, make any build changes, and build it to its final DLL file, which can be imported to any project of its type.
